    <h1>Epidemics in Western Society Since 1600s</h1>

    <h3>About the Course</h3>
    <p>
      This course consists of an international analysis of the impact of
      epidemic diseases on western society and culture from the bubonic plague
      to HIV/AIDS and the recent experience of SARS and swine flu. Leading
      themes include: infectious disease and its impact on society; the
      development of public health measures; the role of medical ethics; the
      genre of plague literature; the social reactions of mass hysteria and
      violence; the rise of the germ theory of disease; the development of
      tropical medicine; a comparison of the social, cultural, and historical
      impact of major infectious diseases; and the issue of emerging and
      re-emerging diseases.
